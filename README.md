### Campus in the Time of COVID-19 

Is a digital humanities project assembled to primarily fulfill requirements for the Advanced Topics in DH course at the University of Lincoln Nebraska, but it's significance has grown beyond the sum of its parts. The project itself transformed into an archive that sought to capture a moment in time and critically investigate its relationship to the past and present through the use of digital platforms and tools.

This repository is both a sustainable and maintainable iteration of preservation for the project's text.
