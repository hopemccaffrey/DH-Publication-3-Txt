The Geography of a PandemicOn September 10, 2020, the Northwestern campus geared-up for the community's return. Yet the 231 acres remained empty. More ducks than people greeted me as I wondered from building to building, photographing the new landscape of college during a global pandemic. Under non-pandemic circumstances, such blatant documentation may have caused me anxiety, yet on the barren campus I was less self-aware. No doubt my positionality, as a white woman, contributed to my comfort as I snapped as many pictures as I felt necessary to capture the altered geography. Increased security presence, plastic signs, blocked doors, and unfinished projects are just a handful of the landmarks I encountered.View the images from campus during COVID-19 on Flickr. To experience the geo-referenced photos as a StoryMap, click here.
