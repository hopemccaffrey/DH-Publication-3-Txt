About the AuthorA historian in training - with a critical eye towards digital humanities.My name is Hope and I am a rising second-year history graduate student at Northwestern University located in Evanston, Illinois. I am very excited to explore the shifting terrain of digital humanities (DH) through critical DH reports focused on academic geography in the time of COVID-19. My area of research, while constantly shifting, is mid-nineteenth-century US history with a focus on women and African American history as well. Right now, I am interested in exploring questions about white women in the antebellum and Civil War era in the lower Midwest (mainly St. Louis and southern Illinois). But I am especially interested in how the digital humanities can tell history in new ways and can make visible narratives that have been historically neglected, whether due to perceptions of “unknowability” based on a lack of archival documents, or persistent historical myths. How can digital tools help us better understand, express, or recover humanity?When not working (which is not very often these days!) as a graduate student, I trail run and climb up mountains whenever possible. During the years between obtaining my bachelor’s degree and starting at Northwestern, I earned a Master of Music in vocal performance and briefly pursued a career as an opera singer.Copyright Hope McCaffrey, CC BY 4.0
